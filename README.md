# Antarang

“Antarang” means inner feelings and emotions. Our project aims to understand user needs through their emotions, creating a tailored and supportive experience.

## About Antarang

Antarang is an AI-powered platform that recognizes user emotions and considers age to provide personalized, emotionally sensitive interactions.
